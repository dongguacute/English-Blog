## Overview

I believe many girls with broad shoulders have experienced anxiety ‚Äî like when shopping for clothes and the model photo looks completely different from the buyer‚Äôs review. For example, a dress that makes someone else look like a princess might make you look like a ‚Äúmuscle Barbie.‚Äù So, this article is here to help solve that problem.

## Weight Loss

When you have broad shoulders, gaining weight can make you look bulky. Take me (Guagua) for example ‚Äî my shoulders are 42 cm wide, and no matter what I wear, I look big. That‚Äôs why staying slim is important. You can find effective weight loss methods on [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/search_result?keyword=%25E5%2587%258F%25E8%2582%25A5&source=unknown).

## Solving Shoulder Thickness

That‚Äôs right, this is also a key issue. Having **thick shoulders** makes you appear even broader. I recommend the following tutorial:

I‚Äôm currently trying this tutorial myself.

## Outfit Styling

Yes yes, this is the most important part, so grab your notebook! I‚Äôll say this only once: humans judge objects by comparison. So if you change the reference point, you can change the perception.

**Tops with small necklines will make your shoulders look broader**. On the other hand, **V-neck or U-neck designs can visually break the horizontal line** and draw the eye downward, making your shoulders look less ‚Äústrong.‚Äù These necklines are also friendly for girls with large chests or thick backs. Try to **avoid tight lower-body clothing**, like pencil skirts. Instead, opt for pleated skirts or JK-style skirts.

**Avoid off-shoulder tops** ‚Äî unless you want to look like a ‚Äúmuscle Barbie‚Äù again. Also, **avoid striped clothing**.

**Puffy-sleeved tops** are a major red flag ‚Äî they make you look bulky. A simple shirt can actually make your shoulders look smaller by comparison.

## Hairstyle

We can use hairstyles to make our shoulders appear smaller. Let your hair fall to shoulder length in front to cover part of your shoulders.
